\f0\fs22 \cf0 Go Figure is a simple and easy to use RPN calculator for the iPhone and iPod Touch.  It features a rearrangeable stack, undo support, and support for significant figures.  \
Go Figure is the only calculator in the App Store with support for Significant Figures.  This means that when you are working with measurements, you can turn significant figures on and the calculator will track sig figs for you to deliver answers to the correct precision.  For times when you are not working with measurements, simply turn sig figs off and the calculator functions as normal.}
